<h1 align="center"> Hello Universe! I'm Marcelo Martins!! </h1>

***25 years old, Brazilian, enthusiastic about the technological and legal world.***

## 🚀 About Me

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am currently a Law student, focused on building connections between the legal world and technological innovation. I am currently transitioning careers, bringing a solid foundation in software development—with practical experience as a Full Stack Developer and in automation projects (RPA), especially those geared towards the legal sector.

My technical background provides me with an analytical, strategic perspective geared towards solving complex problems, skills that I now apply to the study of law, ethics, regulation, and new technologies applied to law.

I am deeply interested in topics such as LGPD (Brazilian General Data Protection Law), Digital Law, Legal Cybersecurity, Compliance, Intellectual Property, and the transformation of the legal system in the information age. I believe that the professional of the future is hybrid, multidisciplinary, and capable of moving between fields of knowledge with responsibility and a critical vision.

Outside the classroom and the world of code, I dedicate myself to the study of Philosophy, Anthropology, Theosophy, Hermeticism, and Theology—areas that broaden my understanding of human beings, society, and the symbolic systems that organize our existence.
